## 🗺️ Overview

Geospatial intelligence combines satellite imagery, drone data, and AI-powered mapping to optimize land use, climate resilience, and crop targeting. In Western Kenya, this approach is especially powerful for region-specific crops like sugarcane, coffee, maize, beans, and bananas.

## 🌾 Crop-Specific Applications

### <span class="fa-icon"><i class="fas fa-cube"></i></span> Sugarcane
- Map high-yield zones based on soil moisture and slope.
- Monitor ratoon crop performance using NDVI time series.
- Detect waterlogging and plan drainage interventions.

### <span class="fa-icon"><i class="fas fa-mug-hot"></i></span> Coffee
- Identify altitude bands optimal for Arabica cultivation.
- Overlay shade tree coverage and pest risk zones.
- Support certification (Rainforest Alliance, Fairtrade) with traceable maps.

### <span class="fa-icon"><i class="fas fa-warehouse"></i></span> Maize
- Predict drought stress using thermal and vegetation indices.
- Guide fertilizer application via soil nutrient maps.
- Track seasonal yield variation across counties.

### <span class="fa-icon"><i class="fas fa-seedling"></i></span> Beans & Pulses
- Cluster agroecological zones for intercropping strategies.
- Detect pest hotspots using farmer-uploaded geotagged images.
- Model rainfall reliability for short-cycle crops.

### <span class="fa-icon"><i class="fas fa-apple-alt"></i></span> Bananas & Horticulture
- Map irrigation potential using proximity to rivers and slope.
- Detect disease spread (e.g., banana wilt) via drone imagery.
- Plan cold chain logistics from farm to market.

## 🧩 Strategic Partnerships

### <span class="fa-icon"><i class="fas fa-seedling"></i></span> Kenya Seed Company
- Target seed varieties to optimal zones using soil and climate data.
- Support demo plots and monitor performance via satellite.
- Map seed distribution networks and overlay farmer adoption rates.

### <span class="fa-icon"><i class="fas fa-industry"></i></span> Village Industrial (VI)
- Identify strategic locations for VI-supported aggregation hubs.
- Optimize supply chains with route analytics and cold chain planning.
- Empower youth-led drone teams for aerial data collection and analysis.

# üå± Farmer-Centered Tools

Our tools start at the farm level, empowering farmers and smallholder networks with adaptive, data-driven solutions:

- **Price Alerts**, **Weather Forecasts**, and **Crop Diagnostics** use real-time data and AI to guide decisions based on local conditions.  
- Platforms for **Farm Records** and **Finance Access** provide tailored insights linked to cropping patterns and repayment histories.  
- **Peer-to-Peer Networks** foster collaboration and timely advice among farmers.  
- Market-focused tools like **Harvest Forecasting**, **Demand Mapping**, and **Smart Routing** optimize aggregation, reduce waste, and respond to dynamic market conditions.  


These tools enable governments, agricultural companies like Kenya Seed, and NGOs to design programs and interventions that are evidence-based and farmer-focused.

# üß† Market Intelligence

Group-level adaptive systems amplify impact across cooperatives, SACCOs, and extension networks:

- **Credit Scoring** and **Yield Forecasting** evolve with repayment behavior and seasonal performance.  
- **SMS Nudges** deliver relevant updates from government programs, cooperatives, and community initiatives.  
- **Research & Trials** integrate indigenous knowledge, refine interventions across zones, and ensure innovations remain locally relevant and validated.  

This intelligence supports governments and organizations in designing programs, monitoring outcomes, and scaling interventions efficiently.

# üó∫Ô∏è Geospatial Intelligence

At the regional scale, geospatial and sensor-driven tools support land use planning, resource allocation, and market linkages:

- **Soil Health Mapping**, **Climate Risk Detection**, and **Crop Suitability Models** improve as satellite, drone, and farmer-reported data accumulate.  
- **Disease Detection** and  **IoT Monitoring** leverage local samples and sensor feedback for timely interventions.  

These insights help county and national governments, companies, and NGOs optimize policy, investments, and operational planning.
